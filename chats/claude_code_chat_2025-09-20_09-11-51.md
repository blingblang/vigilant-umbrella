## Topic: Troubleshooting and Fixing DigitalOcean Observability Stack Deployment

### Summary
This chat session focused on troubleshooting and successfully fixing the centralized observability stack deployment on DigitalOcean that was initially created via Terraform but failed to properly initialize.

### Context
Following the previous session where the observability stack was deployed via Terraform Cloud to DigitalOcean droplet IP 159.89.243.148, the services were not accessible. This session involved diagnosing and resolving the deployment issues.

## Problem Identified

### Initial Symptoms
- Prometheus (port 9090) not loading
- Connection refused on all service ports
- Droplet was running (graphs showed activity in DigitalOcean dashboard)
- Services were not properly initialized

### Root Causes
1. **Cloud-init script failure**: The Terraform user-data script didn't execute completely
2. **Missing configuration files**: Critical config files for Alertmanager and Blackbox Exporter were not created
3. **Incomplete directory structure**: The `/opt/observability-stack` existed but wasn't a git repository and lacked proper configs

## Troubleshooting Process

### Step 1: Connectivity Testing
Created diagnostic scripts to test service availability:
- `check-services.sh` - Check service status
- `wait-for-services.sh` - Wait for services to initialize
- Confirmed droplet was up but services weren't responding

### Step 2: SSH Access Attempts
- Attempted direct SSH from Claude Code environment
- Failed due to lack of SSH key authorization
- Identified that Terraform used DigitalOcean account SSH keys, not local machine keys

### Step 3: DigitalOcean Web Console Access
User accessed the droplet via DigitalOcean's web console interface, bypassing SSH key requirements.

### Step 4: Manual Service Deployment

#### Found State
```bash
/opt/observability-stack/
├── alertmanager/     # Empty directory
├── blackbox/         # Empty directory
├── grafana/
├── nginx/
├── prometheus/
└── docker-compose.yml
```
- Not a git repository
- Missing critical configuration files
- Docker and Docker Compose were installed

#### Fix Applied
1. Removed incomplete deployment:
```bash
rm -rf /opt/observability-stack
```

2. Cloned complete repository from GitHub:
```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/blingblang/vigilant-umbrella.git observability-stack
cd observability-stack
```

3. Created environment configuration:
```bash
echo "GRAFANA_USER=admin" > .env
echo "GRAFANA_PASSWORD=admin123" >> .env
```

4. Set up authentication:
```bash
htpasswd -b -c nginx/htpasswd admin admin123
```

5. Started all services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Final Status

### Successfully Running Services
```
✔ Container cadvisor           Running
✔ Container blackbox-exporter  Running
✔ Container prometheus         Running
✔ Container grafana            Running
✔ Container node-exporter      Running
✔ Container alertmanager       Running
```

### Accessible Endpoints
- **Grafana**: http://159.89.243.148:3000 (admin/admin123)
- **Prometheus**: http://159.89.243.148:9090
- **Alertmanager**: http://159.89.243.148:9093
- **Node Exporter**: http://159.89.243.148:9100
- **Blackbox Exporter**: http://159.89.243.148:9115
- **cAdvisor**: http://159.89.243.148:8080

## Configuration Files Created

### Created During Fix
1. `.env` - Environment variables for Grafana credentials
2. `nginx/htpasswd` - Basic authentication for services
3. All other configs pulled from GitHub repository

## Key Learnings

### Terraform Cloud-Init Issues
1. **Cloud-init can fail silently** - The droplet was created but initialization script didn't complete
2. **Partial execution** - Directory structure was created but configuration files were missing
3. **No automatic recovery** - Required manual intervention to fix

### Solutions Implemented
1. **Manual deployment worked** - Cloning from GitHub and running docker-compose succeeded
2. **DigitalOcean Web Console** - Effective bypass for SSH key issues
3. **GitHub as source of truth** - Having configs in version control enabled quick recovery

### Best Practices Identified
1. **Always verify services after Terraform deployment** - Don't assume cloud-init succeeded
2. **Keep configuration in version control** - Enables quick recovery
3. **Use DigitalOcean console for emergency access** - Bypasses SSH key issues
4. **Test service endpoints immediately** - Catch issues early

## Migration Planning

### Current State
- Central monitoring stack is fully operational at 159.89.243.148
- All services running and accessible
- Ready to receive metrics from remote sites

### Next Steps Decided
1. **First**: Add all websites to central monitoring (completed by user)
2. **Then**: Migrate each of 11 repositories to use central monitoring
3. **Order**: Start with simpler repositories first (super-spork, reimagined-telegram)

### Migration Strategy
For each repository:
1. Website monitoring already active (via Blackbox Exporter)
2. Remove local Prometheus/Grafana containers
3. Keep exporters running for central scraping
4. Configure firewall to allow 159.89.243.148
5. Clean up unused Docker volumes
6. Update documentation

## Files Created/Modified This Session

### Diagnostic Scripts
- `check-services.sh` - Service status checker
- `wait-for-services.sh` - Service availability waiter
- `fix-droplet-services.sh` - Automated fix script
- `auto-fix-droplet.bat` - Windows batch script for fixes

### On Droplet
- `/opt/observability-stack/` - Complete deployment from GitHub
- `.env` file with Grafana credentials
- `nginx/htpasswd` with basic auth

## Important Commands Used

### Docker Management
```bash
docker-compose up -d          # Start all services
docker-compose ps            # Check service status
docker-compose logs [service] # View service logs
docker-compose restart [service] # Restart specific service
```

### Configuration Creation
```bash
echo "GRAFANA_USER=admin" > .env
echo "GRAFANA_PASSWORD=admin123" >> .env
htpasswd -b -c nginx/htpasswd admin admin123
```

## Issues and Resolutions

| Issue | Root Cause | Resolution |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Services not accessible | Cloud-init failed | Manual deployment via console |
| SSH access denied | No authorized keys | Used DigitalOcean web console |
| Alertmanager restarting | Missing config file | Cloned from GitHub |
| Blackbox restarting | Missing config file | Cloned from GitHub |
| Not a git repository | Incomplete cloud-init | Fresh clone from GitHub |

## Session Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-09-20
- **Time**: 09:11:51
- **Duration**: Troubleshooting and successful fix
- **Platform**: Windows (local) / Ubuntu (droplet)
- **Location**: c:\Users\Andrew Mallamo\source\vigilant-umbrella
- **Droplet**: 159.89.243.148 (DigitalOcean)
- **Model**: Claude Opus 4.1 (claude-opus-4-1-20250805)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/blingblang/vigilant-umbrella

## Final Outcome
✅ **Successfully deployed and operational**
- All 6 monitoring services running
- Web interfaces accessible
- Ready for migration of 11 repositories
- Websites already added to monitoring
- Central monitoring fully functional

## Recommendations Going Forward

1. **Monitor the monitors** - Set up alerts for the monitoring stack itself
2. **Document SSH access** - Add proper SSH keys for future access
3. **Terraform debugging** - Review cloud-init logs to understand initial failure
4. **Backup configuration** - Regular backups of Prometheus data
5. **Security hardening** - Change default passwords, implement SSL
